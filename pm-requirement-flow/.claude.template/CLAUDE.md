Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes.

## 1. Think Before Coding
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them.
- If a simpler approach exists, push back.
- If unclear, stop and ask clarification.

## 2. Simplicity First
- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No unrequested "flexibility" or "configurability".
- If 200 lines can be 50, rewrite it.

## 3. Surgical Changes
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing project style.
- Mention dead code but don't delete it unless asked.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution
- Transform tasks into verifiable success criteria.
- State a brief plan for multi-step tasks with checks.
